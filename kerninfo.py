# Subsystem characterisations for various Unix kernels
# (following kerninfo.pm from the Perl scripts)

# Subsystems are characterised by a dictionary with the subsys
# categories as keys. Each value is a list of all directories that comprise 
# the subsystem. None must be used if the subsystem does
# not exist, but this fact is of importance (for instance in a comparison
# of similarly structured systems)

# TODO: For all kernels except Linux, the block layer is missing!
