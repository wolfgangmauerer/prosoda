## Hacky fix for problems with page rank that are (presumably) caused by
## problems in the FORTRAN implementation of igraphdneupd (error 1: Schur form
## computed by LAPACK routine dlahqr). Once this is properly fixed in the
## FORTRAN code, this work-around needs to go away.
## TODO: Acutally, I'm not sure if copying the graph for each try or re-setting
## the RNG is respoinsible for the "fix".
