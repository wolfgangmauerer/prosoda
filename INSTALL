Development Installation
========================

To get a development installation of prosoda which reflects all changes you
make in the code, run:

  python setup.py develop --user

After making sure that $HOME/.local/bin is in the PATH, you should have a
prosoda executable on the command line. Type

  prosoda --help

for more information.

Database Setup
--------------

Prosoda requires a MySQL dabase which is already pre-configured with the
SQL Schema specified in the `bugzilla` repository in the file
DataModel/quantarchSchema.sql. The access credentials and name of the
database is configurable in prosoda.conf

To run the integration tests, a copy of the database with the
default name `quantarch_testing` is also suggested. The access for the
testing database is configurable in prosoda_testing.conf.

Running the REST DB service
---------------------------

Before running prosoda and the prosoda integration tests, you need to make
sure that the prosoda REST DB service is running and using the same
prosoda.conf than prosoda. Currently, the REST service is maintained
in the `webui` repository. To run it, change to the subdirectory node.js and
run: `node prosoda_rest_api.js <path/to/my/prosoda.conf>`.

For integration tests, a REST service using the same prosoda.conf than prosoda
needs to be run. Note that by default, the prosoda test command will use
prosoda_testing.conf.
